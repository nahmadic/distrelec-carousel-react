This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
#Distrelec Technical Test - Front End Engineer

##Constuct An Improved Version Of A Carousel Component 

Using the JSON data source provided we would like you to construct a new and improved version of the 'Related Products' carousel component. An example of this component can be found here:
 
https://www.distrelec.biz/en/oscilloscope-2x100-mhz-gs-keysight-dsox3012a/p/17623260 - Add this product to your cart and navigate to the cart page. Here you will find the related products carousel down the right hand side of the page.

###Essential Requirements
* Clean, Semantic HTML5 - Must Validate Using A Validation Service Such As - https://validator.w3.org/
* Use SASS As A CSS Pre-Processor
* Responsive Using The Mobile First Approach
* Publish To A GitHub / BitBucket Repository With Regular Commits
* All Source Code Should Be In The ./src Folder With Only The Production Code Built Into ./dist

###Desirable Requirements
* Use Of BEM To Structure CSS
* Use Of A Task Runner Such As Gulp Or Grunt - You Should Use This For Compiling, Linting And Minifying CSS / JS
* Use Of Vue.js or similar framework to build the data call and slider functionality

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
